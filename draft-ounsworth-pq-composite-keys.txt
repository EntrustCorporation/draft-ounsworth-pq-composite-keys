       Composite Public and Private Keys For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-00

Abstract

   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different
   cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual
   post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic
   operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it
   requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually.
   This requires defining new structures for holding composite keys, for
   use with composite signature and encryption data.

   This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey,
   CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the respective structure
   for each component algorithm.  This document makes no assumptions
   about what the component algorithms are, provided that they have
   defined algorithm identifiers.  The only requirement imposed by this
   document is that all algorithms be of the same key usage; i.e. all
   signature or all encryption.  This document is intended to be coupled
   with corresponding documents that define the structure and semantics
   of composite signatures and encryption.

1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny.  Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm
   migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to
   migrate to, is not so clear.  Even after the migration period, it may
   be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed
   of multiple public-key algorithms.

   The deployment of composite public keys, and composite signatures and
   composite encryption using post-quantum algorithms will face two
   challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by providing formats for encoding multiple public keys
   and private keys values into existing public key and private key
   fields.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   keys are used within PKIX or CMS structures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: An information object class for identifying the type of
   cryptographic key being encapsulated.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 2.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

2.  Composite Structures

   In order for public keys and private keys to be composed of multiple
   algorithms, we define encodings consisting of a sequence of public
   key or private key primitives (aka "component algorithms") such that
   these structures can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing
   public key fields such as those found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP
   [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor
   Format [RFC5914].

   This section defines the following structures:

   o  The id-alg-composite is an OID identifying a composite public key.

   o  The CompositePublicKey carries all the public keys associated with
      an identity within a single public key structure.

   o  The CompositePrivateKey carries all the private keys associated
      with an identity within a single private key structure.

   EDNOTE 2: We have heard community feedback that the ASN.1 structures
   presented here are too flexible in that allow arbitrary combinations
   of an arbitrary number of signature algorithms.  The feedback is that
   this is too much of a "footgun" for implementors and sysadmins.  We
   are working on an alternative formulation using ASN.1 information
   object classes that allow for compiling explicit pairs of
   algorithmIDs.  We would love community feedback on which approach is
   preferred.  See slide 30 of this presentation:

2.1.  Algorithm Identifier

2.1.1.  Composite Public Key

   The Composite algorithm identifier is used for identifying a public
   key and a private key.  Additional encoding information is provided
   below for each of these objects.

   When using this algorithm identifier it is implied that all component
   keys MUST be used in an AND relation; any cryptographic operation
   using this composite public key MUST use the it as an atomic object
   and use all component keys.  This mode has the strongest security
   properties and is RECOMMENDED.

   There is an additional security consideration that some use cases
   such as signatures remain secure against downgrade attacks if and
   only if component keys are never used in isolation and therefore it
   is RECOMMENDED that component keys in a composite key are uniquely
   generated.

id-composite-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027) Algorithm(80) Composite(4) CompositeKey(1) }

   EDNOTE 3: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.
   We are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 4.

2.1.2.  Composite-OR Public Key

   EDNOTE: This section was written with the intention of keeping the
   primary Composite OID reserved for the simple and strict mode; if you
   want to do either a simple OR, or a custom policy then we have given
   a different OID.  We are still debating whether this is useful to
   specify at issuing time, or whether this is adding needless
   complexity to the draft.

   The Composite-OR algorithm identifier is used for identifying a
   public key and a private key.  Additional encoding information is
   provided below for each of these objects.

   When using this algorithm identifier, component keys MAY be used in
   an OR relation meaning that any one of the component keys may be used
   by itself.  Implementors may also define more complex processes and
   policies using this algorithm identifier, for expmple allowing some
   algorithms by themselves and others only in combination.  This mode
   is provided for applications that need to issue long-lived composite
   keys in a way that allows for backwards compatibility or staged
   adoption of new algorithms.

id-composite-or-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027) Algorithm(80) Composite(4) entrust-Algorithm-Composite-OR(3) }

2.2.  Composite Keys

   A composite key is a single key object that performs an atomic
   signature or verification operation, using its encapsulated sequence
   of component keys.

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for composite public and private keys is:

   pk-Composite PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-composite
       KEY CompositePublicKey
       PARAMS ARE absent
       PRIVATE-KEY CompositePrivateKey
   }

   EDNOTE 4: the authors are currently unsure whether the params should
   be absent (ie this structure simply says "I am a composite
   algorithm"), or used to duplicate some amount of information about
   what the component algoritms are.  See Section 2.3 for a longer
   ENDOTE on this.

2.2.1.  Key Usage

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, any key usage may be used with Composite keys,
   with the requirement that the specified key usage MUST apply to all
   component keys.  For example if a Composite key is marked with a
   KeyUsage of digitalSignature, then all component keys MUST be capable
   of producing digital signatures. id-alg-composite MUST NOT be used to
   implement mixed-usage keys, for example, where a digitalSignature and
   a keyEncipherment key are combined together into a single Composite
   key object.

2.3.  Composite Public Key

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF SubjectPublicKeyInfo

   The corresponding AlgorithmIdentifier for a composite public key MUST
   use the id-alg-composite object identifier, defined in Section 2.1,
   and the parameters field MUST be absent.

   A composite public key MUST contain at least one component public
   key.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2021


   A CompositePublicKey MUST NOT contain a component public key which
   itself describes a composite key; i.e. recursive CompositePublicKeys
   are not allowed

   EDNOTE: unclear that banning recursive composite keys actually
   accomplishes anything other than a general reduction in complexity.
   In particular, with the addition of Composite (AND mode) and
   Composite-OR (OR mode), recursion actually allows full boolean
   expression.  Is this valuable?

   Each element of a CompositePublicKey is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo object
   for a component public key.  When the CompositePublicKey must be
   provided in octet string or bit string format, the data structure is
   encoded as specified in Section 2.5.

2.4.  Composite Private Key

   The composite private key data is represented by the following
   structure:

   CompositePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The corresponding AlgorithmIdentifier for a composite private key
   MUST use the id-alg-composite object identifier, and the parameters
   field MUST be absent.

   A CompositePrivateKey MUST contain at least one component private
   key, and they MUST be in the same order as in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey.

2.5.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

3.  In Practice

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   ~~~ BEGIN EDNOTE 10~~~

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   o  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   o  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   o  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   o  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   o  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

   ~~~ END EDNOTE 10~~~

3.1.  Textual encoding of Composite Private Keys

   CompositePrivateKeys can be encoded to the Privacy-Enhanced Mail
   (PEM) [RFC1421] format by placing a CompositePrivateKey into the
   privateKey field of a PrivateKeyInfo or OneAsymmetricKey object, and
   then applying the PEM encoding rules as defined in [RFC7468] section
   10 and 11 for plaintext and encrypted private keys, respectively.

3.2.  Asymmetric Key Packages (CMS)

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), as defined in [RFC5652], can
   be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt the
   asymmetric key format content type.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2021


   When encoding composite private keys, the privateKeyAlgorithm in the
   OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be set to id-alg-composite.

   The parameters of the privateKeyAlgorithm SHALL be a sequence of
   AlgorithmIdentifier objects, each of which are encoded according to
   the rules defined for each of the different keys in the composite
   private key.

   The value of the privateKey field in the OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be
   set to the DER encoding of the SEQUENCE of private key values that
   make up the composite key.  The number and order of elements in the
   sequence SHALL be the same as identified in the sequence of
   parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.

   The value of the publicKey (if present) SHALL be set to the DER
   encoding of the corresponding CompositePublicKey.  If this field is
   present, the number and order of component keys MUST be the same as
   identified in the sequence of parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.

   The value of the attributes is encoded as usual.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.  The id-composite-key and id-composite-
   or-key OIDs are to be assigned by IANA.  The authors suggest that
   IANA assign an OID on the id-pkix arc:

   id-composite-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
       mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??) }

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Reuse of keys in a Composite public key

   There is an additional security consideration that some use cases
   such as signatures remain secure against downgrade attacks if and
   only if component keys are never used in isolation and therefore it
   is RECOMMENDED that component keys in a composite key are uniquely
   generated.  Note that protocols allowing public keys using the
   Composite-OR algorithm identifier will have a more difficult time
   preventing downgrade and stripping attacks and therefore it is
   RECOMMENDED to use the default AND mode unless the application has a
   strong need for backwards compatability and migration.

5.2.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   structures using that algorithm are implicitly revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since a single public
   key, certificate, or signature may contain a mixture of deprecated
   and non-deprecated algorithms.  Moreover, implementers may decide
   that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security
   properties and are acceptable in combination even though neither
   algorithm is acceptable by itself.

   Specifying a modified verification process to handle these situations
   is beyond the scope of this draft, but could be desirable as the
   subject of an application profile document, or to be up to the
   discretion of implementers.

   2. Check policy to see whether A1, A2, ..., An constitutes a valid
      combination of algorithms.

      if not checkPolicy(A1, A2, ..., An), then
        output "Invalid signature"

   While intentionally not specified in this document, implementors
   should put careful thought into implementing a meaningful policy
   mechanism within the context of their signature verification engines,
   for example only algorithms that provide similar security levels
   should be combined together.

   EDNOTE 11: Max is working on a CRL mechanism to accomplish this.

5.3.  Protection of Private Keys

   Structures described in this document do not protect private keys in
   any way unless combined with a security protocol or encryption
   properties of the objects (if any) where the CompositePrivateKey is
   used (see next Section).

   Protection of the private keys is vital to public key cryptography.
   The consequences of disclosure depend on the purpose of the private
   key.  If a private key is used for signature, then the disclosure
   allows unauthorized signing.  If a private key is used for key
   management, then disclosure allows unauthorized parties to access the
   managed keying material.  The encryption algorithm used in the
   encryption process must be at least as 'strong' as the key it is
   protecting.

5.4.  Checking for Compromised Key Reuse

   Certificate Authority (CA) implementations need to be careful when
   checking for compromised key reuse, for example as required by
   WebTrust regulations; when checking for compromised keys, you MUST
   unpack the CompositePublicKey structure and compare individual
   component keys.  In other words, for the purposes of key reuse
   checks, the composite public key structures need to be un-packed so
   that primitive keys are being compared.  For example if the composite
   key {RSA1, PQ1} is revoked for key compromise, then the keys RSA1 and
   PQ1 need to be indivitually considered revoked.  If the composite key
   {RSA1, PQ2} is submitted for certification, it SHOULD be rejected
   because the key RSA1 was previously declared compromised even though
   the key PQ2 is unique.
