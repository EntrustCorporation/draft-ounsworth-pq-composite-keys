       Composite Public and Private Keys For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-03

Abstract

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
   of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor
   the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the
   required data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and
   elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptalanysis, while the incoming
   post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
   mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that
   have not had sufficient maturing time to rule out classical
   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.

   Cautious implementors may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such
   that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected.  For digital signatures, this is
   referred to as "dual", and for encryption key establishment this as
   reffered to as "hybrid".  This document, and its companions, defines
   a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm called
   "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to
   form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   such that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the
   protocol level.

   EDNOTE: the terms "dual" and "hybrid" are currently in flux.  We
   anticipate an Informational draft to normalize terminology, and will
   update this draft accordingly.

   This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey and
   CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the respective structure
   for each component algorithm.  The generic composite variant is
   defined which allows arbitrary combinations of key types to be placed
   in the CompositePublicKey and CompositePrivateKey structures without
   needing the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed.  The
   explicit variant is alxso defined which allows for a set of algorithm
   identifier OIDs to be registered together as an explicit composite
   algorithm and assigned an OID.

2.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we may also not



Ounsworth, et al.        Expires March 18, 2023                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until further time has
   passed to allow additional scrutiny and the discovery of
   implementation bugs.  Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm
   migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to
   migrate to, is not so clear.  Even after the migration period, it may
   be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed
   of multiple public-key algorithms.

   The deployment of composite public keys, and composite signatures and
   composite encryption using post-quantum algorithms will face two
   challenges:

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Migration: During the transition period, systems will require
      mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully classical
      to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty concerns by providing formats for encoding multiple
   public key and private key values into existing public key and
   private key fields.  Backwards compatibility is not directly
   addressed via the composite mechanisms defined in the document, but
   some notes on how it can be obtained can be found in Section 5.3.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   keys are used within PKIX or CMS structures.

3.  Composite Key Structures

   In order to represent public keys and private keys that are composed
   of multiple algorithms, we define encodings consisting of a sequence
   of public key or private key primitives (aka "components") such that
   these structures can be used directly in existing public key fields
   such as those found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509
   [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor Format [RFC5914].

   A composite key is a single key object that performs an atomic
   cryptographic operation -- such a signing, verifying, encapsulating,
   or decapsulating -- using its encapsulated sequence of component keys
   as if it was a single key.  This generally means that the complexity

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


   of combining algorithms can be deferred from the protocol layer to
   the cryptographic library layer.

3.1.  CompositePublicKey

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF SubjectPublicKeyInfo

   A composite key MUST contain at least two component public keys.

   A CompositePublicKey MUST NOT contain a component public key which
   itself describes a composite key; i.e. recursive CompositePublicKeys
   are not allowed.

   EDNOTE: unclear that banning recursive composite keys actually
   accomplishes anything other than a general reduction in complexity
   and therefore reduction in attack surface.

   Each component SubjectPublicKeyInfo SHALL contain an
   AlgorithmIdentifier OID which identifies the public key type and
   parameters for the public key contained within it.  See Appendix B
   for examples.

   Each element of a CompositePublicKey is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo object
   encoding a component public key.  When the CompositePublicKey must be
   provided in octet string or bit string format, the data structure is
   encoded as specified in Section 3.3.

3.2.  CompositePrivateKey

   EDNOTE: we need to put a bit more effort into private keys,
   specifically defining what OIDs to use in the generic and explicit
   cases.

   This section provides an encoding for composite private keys intended
   for PKIX protocols and other applications that require an
   interoperable format for transmitting private keys, such as PKCS #12
   [RFC7292] or CMP / CRMF [RFC4210], [RFC4211].  It is not intended to
   dictate a storage format in implementations not requiring
   interoperability of private key formats.

   In some cases the private keys that comprise a composite key may not
   be represented in a single structure or even be contained in a single
   cryptographic module.  The establishment of correspondence between
   public keys in a CompositePublicKey and private keys not represented
   in a single composite structure is beyond the scope of this document.




Ounsworth, et al.        Expires March 18, 2023                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


   The composite private key data is represented by the following
   structure:

   CompositePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The parameters field MUST be absent.

   A CompositePrivateKey MUST contain at least two component private
   keys, and they MUST be in the same order as in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey.

   EDNOTE: does this also need an explicit version?  It would probably
   reduce attack surface of tricking a client into running the wrong
   parser and a given piece of data.

3.2.1.  Key Usage

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, any key usage may be used with composite keys,
   with the requirement that the specified key usage MUST apply to all
   component keys.  For example if a composite key is marked with a
   KeyUsage of digitalSignature, then all component keys MUST be capable
   of producing digital signatures.  The composite mechanism MUST NOT be
   used to implement mixed-usage keys, for example, where a
   digitalSignature and a keyEncipherment key are combined together into
   a single composite key.

3.3.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

CompositePublicKeyOs ::= OCTET STRING (CONTAINING CompositePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   EDNOTE: will this definition include an ASN.1 tag and length byte
   inside the OCTET STRING object?  If so, that's probably an extra
   uneccessary layer.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first

   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

CompositePublicKeyBs ::= BIT STRING (CONTAINING CompositePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   EDNOTE: See this LAMPS mailist discussion about BIT STRING vs OCTET
   STRING for public keys.  I think we have dodged the issue, but may we
   worth re-visiting.  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/spasm/Gv-
   ACiOpYZfOM0AJEZUX1jIhVq0/

4.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This section defines the algorithm identifier for generic composite,
   as well as a framework for defining explicit combinations.  This
   section is not intended to be exhaustive and other authors may define
   others so long as they are compatible with the structures and
   processes defined in this and companion signature and encryption
   documents.

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility for client to use any
   combination of supported algorithms, while others desire the rigidity
   of explicitly-specified combinations of algorithms.

   TODO: blurb about why we have chosen the combinations that we did.  *
   No SPHINCS+ because here we are only considering composite AND modes
   where a composite of SPHINCS+ does not add value over pure SPHINCS+.
   ... or should we to bridge across implementation bugs (CVEs)? * We
   have tried to pair components of equivalent strengths so that even if
   one component algorithm is broken, then the overall strength of the
   composite remains the same.

4.1.  id-composite-key (Generic Composite Keys)

   This mode is primarily for prototyping and for use in proprietary
   implementations; implementers MAY implement this section if there is
   a need for greater flexibility in algorithm combinations than is
   available by using the pre-defined composite algorithms defined
   below.

   EDNOTE: Does the WG feel strongly that this section should be removed
   prior to publication by the RFC Editors?  IE remove it entirely from
   the standard?

   The id-composite-key object identifier is used for identifying a
   generic composite public key and a generic composite private key.
   This allows arbitrary combinations of key types to be placed in the
   CompositePublicKey and CompositePrivateKey structures without needing
   the combination to be pre-registered or standardized.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


id-composite-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027)
    Algorithm(80) Composite(4) CompositeKey(1) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 6.

   The PUBLIC-KEY ASN.1 information object class is defined in
   [RFC5912].  The PUBLIC-KEY information object for generic
   (Section 4.1) and explicit (Section 4.2) composite public and private
   keys has the following form:

   pk-Composite PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       id id-composite-key
       KeyValue CompositePublicKey
       Params ARE ABSENT
       PrivateKey CompositePrivateKey
   }

   The motivation for this variant is primarily for prototyping work
   prior to the standardization of algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations of algorithms.  However, the authors envision that this
   variant will remain relevant beyond full standardization for example
   in environments requiring very high levels of crypto agility, for
   example where clients support a large number of algorithms or where a
   large number of keys will be used at a time and it is therefore
   prohibitive to define algorithm identifiers for every combination of
   pairs, triples, quadruples, etc of algorithms.

4.2.  Explicit Composite Signature Keys

   This variant provides a rigid way of specifying supported
   combinations of key types.

   The motivation for this variant is to make it easier to reference and
   enforce specific combinations of algorithms.  The authors envision
   this being useful for client-server negotiated protocols, protocol
   designers who wish to place constraints on allowable algorithm
   combinations in the protocol specification, as well as audited
   environments that wish to prove that only certain combinations will
   be supported by clients.

   Profiles need to define an explicit composite key type which consists
   of, at the minimum.

   o  A new algorithm identifier OID for the explicit algorithm.

   o  The PUBLIC-KEY information object of each component public key
      type.

   See Appendix A for guidance on creating and registering OIDs for
   specific explicit combinations.

   In this variant, the public key is encoded as defined in Section 3
   and Section 3.1, however the PUBLIC-KEY.id SHALL be an OID which is
   registered to represent a specific combination of component public
   key types.  See Appendix B for examples.

   The SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm for each component key is
   redundant information which MUST match -- and can be inferred from --
   the specification of the explicit algorithm.  It has been left here
   for ease of implementation as the component SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   structures are the same between generic and explicit, as well as with
   single-algorithm keys.  However, it introduces the risk of mismatch
   and leads to the following security consideration:

   Security consideration: Implementations MUST check that the component
   AlgorithmIdentifier OIDs and parameters match those expected by the
   definition of the explicit algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD first
   parse a component's SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm, and ensure that
   it matches what is expected for that position in the explicit key,
   and then proceed to parse the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey.
   This is to reduce the attack surface associated with parsing the
   public key data of an unexpected key type, or worse; to parse and use
   a key which does not match the explicit algorithm definition.
   Similar checks MUST be done when handling the corresponding private
   key.

   TODO: ref to draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs

   EDNOTE: for the algorithms including elliptic curve ECDSA, should the
   curve (NIST P256, Brainpool P256r1, etc) be specified in the OID, or
   should we leave this out of the OID and include it in the params?  I
   know the WG has a general distaste for params, but this is a source
   of OID explosion.

4.2.1.  id-Dilithium3-ECDSA-P256

   Usage guidance: This signature key type is intended to be the
   standard composite signature, applicable for most use cases.

   The following object identifier is defined:

   id-Dilithium3-ECDSA-P256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { TBD }

5.  Implementation Considerations

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   o  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   o  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

5.1.  Textual encoding of Composite Private Keys

   CompositePrivateKeys can be encoded to the Privacy-Enhanced Mail
   (PEM) [RFC1421] format by placing a CompositePrivateKey into the
   privateKey field of a PrivateKeyInfo or OneAsymmetricKey object, and
   then applying the PEM encoding rules as defined in [RFC7468] section
   10 and 11 for plaintext and encrypted private keys, respectively.

5.2.  Asymmetric Key Packages (CMS)

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), as defined in [RFC5652], can
   be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt the
   asymmetric key format content type.

   When encoding composite private keys, the privateKeyAlgorithm in the
   OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be set to id-composite-key or to an OID
   corresponding to an explicit composite key.

   The parameters of the privateKeyAlgorithm SHALL be a sequence of
   AlgorithmIdentifier objects, each of which are encoded according to
   the rules defined for each of the different keys in the composite
   private key.

   The value of the privateKey field in the OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be
   set to the DER encoding of the SEQUENCE of private key values that
   make up the composite key.  The number and order of elements in the
   sequence SHALL be the same as identified in the sequence of
   parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.

   The value of the publicKey (if present) SHALL be set to the DER
   encoding of the corresponding CompositePublicKey.  If this field is
   present, the number and order of component keys MUST be the same as
   identified in the sequence of parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.

   The value of the attributes is encoded as usual.

   EDNOTE: I wonder whether this has value as its own section, or if we
   should take what's relevant and merge it into Section 3.2?

5.3.  Backwards Compatibility

   As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic
   migration will face challenges in both ensuring cryptographic
   strength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as
   providing ease of migration.  The composite mechanisms defined in
   this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this
   section contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be
   obtained.

   The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing
   systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without
   requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades.  The term
   "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more
   specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


   These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought
   about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of
   X.509 and PKIX with relation to public key objects, from online
   negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2 [RFC7296],
   to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME signed and
   encrypted email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of
   the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code
   signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized
   and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS
   [RFC5652] signed or encrypted structures.

5.3.1.  OR modes

   This document purposefully does not specify how clients are to
   combine component keys together to form a single cryptographic
   operation; this is left up to the specifications of signature and
   encryption algorithms that make use of the composite key type.  One
   possible way to combine component keys is through an OR relation, or
   OR-like client policies for acceptable algorithm combinations, where
   senders and / or receivers are permitted to ignore some component
   keys.  Some envisioned uses of this include environments where the
   client encounters a component key for which it does not possess a
   compatible algorithm implementation but wishes to proceed with the
   cryptographic operation using the subset of component keys for which
   it does have compatible implementations.  Such a mechanism could be
   designed to provide ease of migration by allowing for composite keys
   to be distributed and used before all clients in the environment are
   fully upgraded, but it does not allow for full backwards
   compatibility since clients would at least need to be upgraded from
   their current state to be able to parse the composite structures.

5.3.2.  Parallel PKIs

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same key type (signature, key establishment, etc) for the
   same identity (name, SAN), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client
   would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certificate(s) to use in a given cryptographic operation.





Ounsworth, et al.        Expires March 18, 2023                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


   For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s)
   or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms, or could
   combine two of the public keys for example in a non-composite hybrid
   method such as [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth] or
   [I-D.guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth].  Note that it is possible to
   use the signature algorithm defined in
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs] as a way to carry the multiple
   signature values generated by a non-composite public mechanism in
   protocols where it is easier to support the composite signature
   algorithms than to implement such a mechanism in the protocol itself.
   There is also nothing precluding a composite public key from being
   one of the components used within a non-composite authentication
   operation; this may lead to greater convenience in setting up
   parallel PKI hierarchies that need to service a range of clients
   implementing different styles of post-quantum migration strategies.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652], the inclusion of multiple SignerInfo or RecipientInfo
   objects is often already treated as an OR relationship, so including
   one for each of the end entity's parallel PKI public keys would, in
   many cases, have the desired effect of allowing the receiver to
   choose one they are compatible with and ignore the others, thus
   achieving full backwards compatibility.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following in the SMI "Security for PKIX
   Algorithms (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.6)" registry:

   id-composite-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
       mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) id-composite-key(??) }

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Reuse of keys in a Composite public key

   There is an additional security consideration that some use cases
   such as signatures remain secure against downgrade attacks if and
   only if component keys are never used outside of their composite
   context and therefore it is RECOMMENDED that component keys in a
   composite key are not to be re-used in other contexts.  In
   particular, the components of a composite key SHOULD NOT also appear
   in single-key certificates.  This is particularly relevant for
   protocols that use composite keys in a logical AND mode since the
   appearance of the same component keys in single-key contexts
   undermines the binding of the component keys into a single composite

   key by allowing messages signed in a multi-key AND mode to be
   presented as if they were signed in a single key mode in what is
   known as a "stripping attack".

7.2.  Key mismatch in explicit composite

   This security consideration copied from Section 4.2.

   Implementations MUST check that that the component
   AlgorithmIdentifier OIDs and parameters match those expected by the
   definition of the explicit algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD first
   parse a component's SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm, and ensure that
   it matches what is expected for that position in the explicit key,
   and then proceed to parse the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey.
   This is to reduce the attack surface associated with parsing the
   public key data of an unexpected key type, or worse; to parse and use
   a key which does not match the explicit algorithm definition.
   Similar checks MUST be done when handling the corresponding private
   key.

7.3.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   clients performing signature verification or encryption operations
   should be updated to fail to validate or refuse to encrypt for these
   algorithms.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key, certificate, signature, or ciphertext
   MAY contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Specifying behaviour in these cases is beyond the scope of this
   document, but should be considered by implementers and potentially in
   additional standards.

   EDNOTE: Max is working on a CRL mechanism to accomplish this.

7.4.  Protection of Private Keys

   Structures described in this document do not protect private keys in
   any way unless combined with a security protocol or encryption
   properties of the objects (if any) where the CompositePrivateKey is
   used (see next Section).



Ounsworth, et al.        Expires March 18, 2023                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys             September 2022


   Protection of the private keys is vital to public key cryptography.
   The consequences of disclosure depend on the purpose of the private
   key.  If a private key is used for signature, then the disclosure
   allows unauthorized signing.  If a private key is used for key
   management, then disclosure allows unauthorized parties to access the
   managed keying material.  The encryption algorithm used in the
   encryption process must be at least as 'strong' as the key it is
   protecting.

7.5.  Checking for Compromised Key Reuse

   Certification Authority (CA) implementations need to be careful when
   checking for compromised key reuse, for example as required by
   WebTrust regulations; when checking for compromised keys, you MUST
   unpack the CompositePublicKey structure and compare individual
   component keys.  In other words, for the purposes of key reuse
   checks, the composite public key structures need to be un-packed so
   that primitive keys are being compared.  For example if the composite
   key {RSA1, PQ1} is revoked for key compromise, then the keys RSA1 and
   PQ1 need to be individually considered revoked.  If the composite key
   {RSA1, PQ2} is submitted for certification, it SHOULD be rejected
   because the key RSA1 was previously declared compromised even though
   the key PQ2 is unique.

Appendix A.  Creating explicit combinations

   The following ASN.1 Information Objects may be useful in defining and
   parsing explicit pairs of public key types.  Given an ASN.1 2002
   compliant ASN.1 compiler, these Information Objects will enforce the
   binding between the public key types specified in the instantiation
   of pk-explicitComposite, and the wire objects which implement it.
   The one thing that is not enforced automatically by this Information
   Object is that publicKey.params are intended to be absent if and only
   if they are absent for the declared public key type.  This ASN.1
   module declares them OPTIONAL and leaves it to implementers to
   perform this check explicitly.

   EDNOTE this ASN.1 needs to change.  The current definition doesn't
   put a component AlgorithmIdentifier with each component key.  Once we
   agree as a group that the text accurately describes what we want, we
   can spend a bit of time figuring out if the ASN.1 machinery lets us
   express it in a readable way and/or a way that will actually help
   people creating explicit pairs.

  -- pk-explicitComposite - Composite public key information object

  pk-explicitComposite{OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id, PUBLIC-KEY:firstPublicKey,
   FirstPublicKeyType, PUBLIC-KEY:secondPublicKey, SecondPublicKeyType}
   PUBLIC-KEY ::= {PUBLIC-KEYPUBLIC-KEY
      IDENTIFIER id
      KEY ExplicitCompositePublicKey{firstPublicKey, FirstPublicKeyType,
       secondPublicKey, SecondPublicKeyType}
      PARAMS ARE absent
      CERT-KEY-USAGE {digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign,
        cRLSign}
  }

   The following ASN.1 object class then automatically generates the
   public key structure from the types defined in pk-explicitComposite.

-- ExplicitCompositePublicKey - The data structure for a composite
-- public key sec-composite-pub-keys and SecondPublicKeyType are needed
-- because PUBLIC-KEY contains a set of public key types, not a single
-- type.
-- TODO The parameters should be optional only if they are marked
-- optional in the PUBLIC-KEY.


ExplicitCompositePublicKey{PUBLIC-KEY:firstPublicKey, FirstPublicKeyType,
  PUBLIC-KEY:secondPublicKey, SecondPublicKeyType} ::= SEQUENCE {
    firstPublicKey SEQUENCE {
        params firstPublicKey.&Params OPTIONAL,
        publicKey FirstPublicKeyType
    },
    secondPublicKey SEQUENCE {
        params secondPublicKey.&Params OPTIONAL,
        publicKey SecondPublicKeyType
    }
}

   Using this module, it becomes trivial to define explicit pairs.  For
   an example, see Appendix B.2.

   To define explicit triples, quadruples, etc, these Information
   Objects can be extended to have thirdPublicKey, fourthPublicKey, etc
   throughout.

   }

   Then the same key as above could be encoded as an explicit composite
   public key as:
