       Composite Public and Private Keys For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-02

Abstract

   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different
   cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual
   post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic
   operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it
   requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually.
   This requires defining new structures for holding composite keys, for
   use with composite signature and encryption data.

   This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey,
   CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the respective structure
   for each component algorithm.  The generic composite variant makes no
   assumptions about what the component algorithms are, provided that
   they have defined algorithm identifiers.  The only requirement
   imposed by this document is that all algorithms be of the same key
   usage; i.e. all signature or all encryption.  Some use-cases require
   defining valid combinations is policy, or to know the key types
   before parsing the key data, so this document also defines the
   explicit composite variant which allows for
   AlgorithmIdentifier.algorithm OIDs to be registered which specify an
   explicit combination of algorithms.

   This document is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents
   that define the structure and semantics of composite signatures and
   encryption.

1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny.  Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm
   migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to
   migrate to, is not so clear.  Even after the migration period, it may
   be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed
   of multiple public-key algorithms.

   The deployment of composite public keys, and composite signatures and
   composite encryption using post-quantum algorithms will face two
   challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Migration: During the transition period, systems will require
      mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully classical
      to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   This document provides a mechanism to address both algorithm strength
   uncertainty as well as migration concerns by providing formats for
   encoding multiple public keys and private keys values into existing
   public key and private key fields.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   keys are used within PKIX or CMS structures.

   EDNOTE A previous version of this draft specified alternate algorithm
   identifiers for AND and OR modes.  As well, a similar spec by D-Trust
   (now co-authors of this draft) also specified a "K of N" mode.  In
   this version of this draft, we have moved those from being top-level
   OIDs to being algorithm parameters since we can then leverage the
   same mechanism for both generic and explicit composite modes.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: An information object class for identifying the type of
   cryptographic key being encapsulated.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a key at runtime.  This
   includes a signer, verifyir, encryptor, decryptor.

   COMBINER MODE: A combiner mode specifies how keys are to be combined
   together into a single cryptographic operation.  Examples include
   AND, OR, K-of-N.  Specifications of composite signature or encryption
   proceedures will need to specify the behaviour under each mode.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

2.  Composite Keys

   In order for public keys and private keys to be composed of multiple
   algorithms, we define encodings consisting of a sequence of public
   key or private key primitives (aka "components") such that these
   structures can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing public
   key fields such as those found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210],
   X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor Format
   [RFC5914].

   A composite key is a single key object that performs an atomic
   cryptographic operation -- such a signing, verifying, encapsulating,
   or decapsulating -- using its encapsulated sequence of component keys
   as if it was a single key.

   The PUBLIC-KEY ASN.1 Class is defined in [RFC5912].  The profile of a
   PUBLIC-KEY for for composite public and private keys is:

   pk-Composite PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       id id-composite-key,
       KeyValue CompositePublicKey,
       Params CompositeParams ARE OPTIONAL,
       PrivateKey CompositePrivateKey,
   }

   The identifier id-composite-key indicates that this is a Generic
   Composite key as defined in Section 2.5.1.  Profiles which define
   Explicit combinations MUST use the same structure, but replace the ID
   with an explicitely-defined OID for that combination of algorithms as
   described in Section 2.5.2.

   Algorithm parameters are used to convey the mode for combining
   multiple keys into a single cryptographic operation.  If algorithm
   parameters are absent, then clients MUST interpret this as AND, as
   defined in Section 2.6.1.  If the algorithm parameters do not conform
   to Section 2.2.1 or they contain a combiner mode OID that is not
   recognized by the client, then the client MUST fail to parse the
   composite key.

   EDNOTE: The authors debated whether an unrecognized mode MAY be
   treated as AND, but in the interest of simplicity we have left it as
   MUST fail.  If there are use-cases that require this, we could
   consider changing it.

   Some basic modes are defined in Section 2.6 with extensibility for
   additional or custom modes to be defined in the future to suit
   specific use-cases.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


   A composite key MUST contain at least two component public keys.

2.1.  Key Usage

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, any key usage may be used with Composite keys,
   with the requirement that the specified key usage MUST apply to all
   component keys.  For example if a Composite key is marked with a
   KeyUsage of digitalSignature, then all component keys MUST be capable
   of producing digital signatures. id-alg-composite MUST NOT be used to
   implement mixed-usage keys, for example, where a digitalSignature and
   a keyEncipherment key are combined together into a single Composite
   key object.

2.2.  Composite Public Key

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF SubjectPublicKeyInfo

   A CompositePublicKey MUST NOT contain a component public key which
   itself describes a composite key; i.e. recursive CompositePublicKeys
   are not allowed.

   Each component SubjectPublicKeyInfo SHALL contain an
   AlgorithmIdentifier OID which identifies the public key type and
   params for the public key contained within it.  See Section 6.2 for
   examples.

   EDNOTE: unclear that banning recursive composite keys actually
   accomplishes anything other than a general reduction in complexity
   and therefore reduction in attack surface.  In particular, with the
   addition of Composite (AND mode) and Composite-OR (OR mode),
   recursion actually allows full boolean expression.  Is this valuable?

   Each element of a CompositePublicKey is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo object
   encoding a component public key.  When the CompositePublicKey must be
   provided in octet string or bit string format, the data structure is
   encoded as specified in Section 2.4.

2.2.1.  CompositeParams

   CompositeParams ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

   where the algorithm and parameters represent a combiner mode as
   defined in Section 2.6.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


2.3.  Composite Private Key

   EDNOTE: we need to put a bit more effort into private keys,
   specificially defining what OIDs to use in the generic and explicit
   cases.

   The composite private key data is represented by the following
   structure:

   CompositePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The parameters field MUST be absent.

   A CompositePrivateKey MUST contain at least two component private
   keys, and they MUST be in the same order as in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey.

   EDNOTE: does this also need an explicit version?

2.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

CompositePublicKeyOs ::= OCTET STRING (CONTAINING CompositePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

CompositePublicKeyBs ::= BIT STRING (CONTAINING CompositePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

2.5.  Generic vs Explicit Variants

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility of choosing any combination of
   supported algorithms at runtime, while others desire the rigidity

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


2.5.1.  Generic Composite Public Key

   The Composite-Key algorithm identifier is used for identifying a
   generic public key and a private key.

id-composite-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027)
    Algorithm(80) Composite(4) CompositeKey(1) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 4.

   This variant provides a completely generic structure where key can be
   combined into arbitrary combinations of number and types of keys by
   runtime agents.

   The motivation for this variant is primarily for prototyping work
   prior to the standardization of algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations of algorithms.  However, the authors envision that this
   variant will remain relevant beyond full standardization for example
   in environments requiring very high levels of crypto agility, for
   example where clients support a large number of algorithms or where a
   large number of keys will be used at a time and it is therefore
   prohibitive to define algorithm identifiers for every combination of
   pairs, triples, quadtuples, etc of algorithms.

2.5.2.  Explicit Composite Public Key

   This variant provides a rigid way of specifying supported
   combinations of algorithms.

   The motivation for this variant is to make it easier to reference and
   enforce specific combinations of algorithms.  The authors envision
   this being useful for client-server negotiated protocols, protocol
   designers who wish to place constraints on allowable algorithm
   combinations in the protocol specification, as well as audited
   environments that wish to prove that only certain combinations will
   be supported by clients.

   Profiles need to define an explicit algorithm which consists of:

   o  A new algorithm identifier OID for the explicit algorithm.

   o  The algorithm identifier OID and PUBLIC-KEY type of each component
      algorithm.

   See Section 6.1 for guidance on creating and registering OIDs for
   specific explicit combinations.



Ounsworth, et al.      Expires September 23, 2022               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


   In this variant, the public key is encoded as defined in Section 2
   and Section 2.2, however the PUBLIC-KEY.id SHALL be an OID which is
   registered to represent a specific combination of component public
   key types.  See Section 6.2 for examples.

   The SubjectPublicKey.algorithm for each component key is redundant
   information which MUST match -- and can be infered at runtime from --
   the specification of the explicit algorithm.  It has been left here
   for ease of implementation as the component SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   structures are the same between genaric and explicit, as well as with
   single-algorithm keys.  However, it introduces the risk of mismatch
   and leads to the following security consideration:

   Security consideration: implementations MUST check that that the
   component AlgorithmIdentifier OIDs match those expected by the
   definition of the explicit algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD first
   parse a component's SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm, and ensure that
   it matches what is expected for that position in the explicit key,
   and then proceed to parse the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey.
   This is to reduce the attack surface associated with parsing the
   public key data of an unexpected key type, or worse; to parse and use
   a key which does not match the explicit algorithm definition.
   Similar checks MUST be done when handling the corresponding private
   key.

2.6.  Combiner Modes

   Once an end entity has been issued multiple public keys, it is easy
   to imagine different modes and policies for using these keys.  For
   example a logical AND would provide the strictest security by
   requiring any usage of a composite key to always use all component
   keys.  Meanwhile, a logical OR would provide the greatest migration
   flexibility by allowing any component key to be used by itself.
   There can also be modes in between the two extremes such as a "K of
   N" mode, or a policy explicitly listing acceptable combinations of
   algorithms.

   A combiner mode is represented in a composite public key by an
   OPTIONAL AlgorithmIdentifier where the semantics are defined in the
   following sections.  Any signature or encryption processes that make
   use of these modes need to define the precise behaviour under each
   mode.

2.6.1.  AND Mode

   Indicated by leaving the algorithm parameters ABSENT.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


   The intention of this mode is that any cryptographic operation
   involving this composite key MUST use all component keys.  This mode
   is intended to provide the strictest security and for that reason it
   is the default mode.

2.6.2.  OR Mode

   Indicated by CompositeParams with and algorithm equal to:

id-composite-or OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027)
  Algorithm(80) Composite(4) id-composite-or(3) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 4.

   The parameters of the CompositeParams MUST be ABSENT.

   The intention of this mode is that any one component MAY be used by
   itself; senders MAY use more than one component key but receivers
   only need to use one to verify or recover the plaintext message.
   This mode is intended to provide the greatest migration and
   transition flexibility.

   EDNOTE: Potential problem with this mode: logically, as long as the
   client understands at least one of the component OIDs, but with the
   structure SEQUENCE OF SubjectPublicKeyInfo it is likely that most
   ASN.1 parsers will fail on an unrecognized OID.  For more discussion
   on this point, see: https://github.com/EntrustCorporation/draft-
   ounsworth-pq-composite-keys/issues/4

2.6.3.  ANY Mode

   Indicated by CompositeParams with and algorithm equal to:

id-composite-any OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027)
  Algorithm(80) Composite(4) id-composite-any(7) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 4.

   The parameters of the CompositeParams MUST be ABSENT.

   The intention of this mode is for use-cases where the combiner mode
   is explicitly not carried in the public key and applications need to
   retrieve the combiner mode from application context, for example from
   application policy.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


2.6.4.  K of N Mode

   Indicated by CompositeParams with and algorithm equal to:

id-composite-k-of-n OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) entrust(114027)
  Algorithm(80) Composite(4) id-composite-k-of-n(2)  }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 4.

   The parameters of the CompositeParams MUST be CompositeKofNParams:

   CompositeKofNParams ::= INTEGER

   The intention of this mode is for use-cases where a subset or
   threshold scheme is desired.  The value in CompositeKofNParams is K,
   the number of component keys to be used in a single cryptographic
   operation.  The total number of component keys, N, is not carried in
   the CompositeKofNParams and can be infered either by parsing the
   CompositePublicKey structure as defined in Section 2.2, or in the
   case of the explicit composite variant, N may be known based on the
   PUBLIC-KEY IDENTIFIER.

   Clients SHOULD NOT use K of N mode with K = N as it is semantically
   equivalent to the AND mode defined in Section 2.6.1.

   Clients SHOULD NOT use K of N mode with K = 1 as it is semantically
   equivanent to the OR mode defined in Section 2.6.2.

   The intention is to improve interoperability between clients that
   support K of N mode and those that only support AND or OR mode.  The
   signature and encryption processes for K of N mode are more complex
   to implement than the respective AND and OR modes, and in most cases
   they would be a superset of the respective AND and OR modes, so it is
   assumed that any client that supports K of N mode will also support
   AND and OR modes.  The converse is not true; for example a simple
   client may only support AND mode and would reject a K of N mode with
   K = N even though it is semantically equivalent to a mode that it
   supports.  Therefore clients that support K of N mode SHOULD use AND
   mode (Section 2.6.1) and OR mode (Section 2.6.2) in place of K of N
   mode with K = N and K = 1 respectively.

2.6.5.  Custom Modes

   Protocol designers and implementors are free to define other combiner
   modes.

3.  In Practice

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   o  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   o  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   o  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   o  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   o  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

3.1.  Textual encoding of Composite Private Keys

   CompositePrivateKeys can be encoded to the Privacy-Enhanced Mail
   (PEM) [RFC1421] format by placing a CompositePrivateKey into the
   privateKey field of a PrivateKeyInfo or OneAsymmetricKey object, and
   then applying the PEM encoding rules as defined in [RFC7468] section
   10 and 11 for plaintext and encrypted private keys, respectively.

3.2.  Asymmetric Key Packages (CMS)

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), as defined in [RFC5652], can
   be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt the
   asymmetric key format content type.

   When encoding composite private keys, the privateKeyAlgorithm in the
   OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be set to id-alg-composite.

   The parameters of the privateKeyAlgorithm SHALL be a sequence of
   AlgorithmIdentifier objects, each of which are encoded according to
   the rules defined for each of the different keys in the composite
   private key.




Ounsworth, et al.      Expires September 23, 2022              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


   The value of the privateKey field in the OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be
   set to the DER encoding of the SEQUENCE of private key values that
   make up the composite key.  The number and order of elements in the
   sequence SHALL be the same as identified in the sequence of
   parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.

   The value of the publicKey (if present) SHALL be set to the DER
   encoding of the corresponding CompositePublicKey.  If this field is
   present, the number and order of component keys MUST be the same as
   identified in the sequence of parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.

   The value of the attributes is encoded as usual.

   EDNOTE: I wonder whether this has value as its own section, or if we
   should take what's relevant and merge it into Section 2.3?

4.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.  The id-composite-key and id-composite-
   or-key OIDs are to be assigned by IANA.  The authors suggest that
   IANA assign an OID on the id-pkix arc:

   id-composite-key OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
       mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??) }

   id-composite-or OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
     iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
     mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??)
     id-composite-or(??) }

   id-composite-any OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
     iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
       mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??)
       id-composite-any(??) }

   id-composite-k-of-n OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
     iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
     mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??)
     id-composite-k-of-n(??)  }

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Reuse of keys in a Composite public key

   There is an additional security consideration that some use cases
   such as signatures remain secure against downgrade attacks if and
   only if component keys are never used outside of their composite



Ounsworth, et al.      Expires September 23, 2022              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


   context and therefore it is RECOMMENDED that component keys in a
   composite key are not to be re-used in other contexts.  In
   particular, the components of a composite key SHOULD NOT also appear
   in single-key certificates.  This is particularly relevant for
   protocols that use composite keys in a logical AND mode since the
   appearance of the same component keys in single-key contexts
   undermines the binding of the component keys into a single composite
   key by allowing messages signed in a multi-key AND mode to be
   presented as if they were signed in a single key mode in what is
   known as a "stripping attack".

5.2.  Key mismatch in explicit composite

   This security consideration copied from Section 2.5.2.

   Implementations MUST check that that the component
   AlgorithmIdentifier OIDs match those expected by the definition of
   the explicit algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD first parse a
   component's SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm, and ensure that it
   matches what is expected for that position in the explicit key, and
   then proceed to parse the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey.
   This is to reduce the attack surface associated with parsing the
   public key data of an unexpected key type, or worse; to parse and use
   a key which does not match the explicit algorithm definition.
   Similar checks MUST be done when handling the corresponding private
   key.

5.3.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   structures using that algorithm are implicitly revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key, certificate, signature, or ciphertext
   may contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Specifying behaviour in these cases is beyond the scope of this
   document, but should be considered by implementors and potentially in
   addiniotal standards.

   EDNOTE: Max is working on a CRL mechanism to accomplish this.

5.4.  Protection of Private Keys

   Structures described in this document do not protect private keys in
   any way unless combined with a security protocol or encryption
   properties of the objects (if any) where the CompositePrivateKey is
   used (see next Section).

   Protection of the private keys is vital to public key cryptography.
   The consequences of disclosure depend on the purpose of the private
   key.  If a private key is used for signature, then the disclosure
   allows unauthorized signing.  If a private key is used for key
   management, then disclosure allows unauthorized parties to access the
   managed keying material.  The encryption algorithm used in the
   encryption process must be at least as 'strong' as the key it is
   protecting.

5.5.  Checking for Compromised Key Reuse

   Certificate Authority (CA) implementations need to be careful when
   checking for compromised key reuse, for example as required by
   WebTrust regulations; when checking for compromised keys, you MUST
   unpack the CompositePublicKey structure and compare individual
   component keys.  In other words, for the purposes of key reuse
   checks, the composite public key structures need to be un-packed so
   that primitive keys are being compared.  For example if the composite
   key {RSA1, PQ1} is revoked for key compromise, then the keys RSA1 and
   PQ1 need to be indivitually considered revoked.  If the composite key
   {RSA1, PQ2} is submitted for certification, it SHOULD be rejected
   because the key RSA1 was previously declared compromised even though
   the key PQ2 is unique.

6.  Appendices

6.1.  Creating explicit combinations

   The following ASN.1 Information Objects may be useful in defining and
   parsing explicit pairs of public key types.  Given an ASN.1 2002
   compliant ASN.1 compiler, these Information Objects will enforce the
   binding between the public key types specified in the instantiation
   of pk-explicitComposite, and the wire objects which implement it.
   The one thing that is not enforced automatically by this Information
   Object is that publicKey.params are intended to be absent if and only
   if they are absent for the declared public key type.  This ASN.1
   module declares them OPTIONAL and leaves it to implementors to
   perform this check explicitely.

   EDNOTE this ASN.1 needs to change.  The current definition doesn't
   put a component AlgorithmIdentifier with each component key.  Once we

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                 March 2022


   agree as a group that the text accurately describes what we want, we
   can spend a bit of time figuring out if the ASN.1 machinery lets us
   express it in a readable way and/or a way that will actually help
   people creating explicit pairs.

  -- pk-explicitComposite - Composite public key information object

  pk-explicitComposite{OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id, PUBLIC-KEY:firstPublicKey,
   FirstPublicKeyType, PUBLIC-KEY:secondPublicKey, SecondPublicKeyType}
   PUBLIC-KEY ::= {PUBLIC-KEYPUBLIC-KEY
      IDENTIFIER id
      KEY ExplicitCompositePublicKey{firstPublicKey, FirstPublicKeyType,
       secondPublicKey, SecondPublicKeyType}
      PARAMS ARE absent
      CERT-KEY-USAGE {digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign,
        cRLSign}
  }

   The following ASN.1 object class then automatically generates the
   public key structure from the types defined in pk-explicitComposite.

-- ExplicitCompositePublicKey - The data structure for a composite
-- public key sec-composite-pub-keys and SecondPublicKeyType are needed
-- because PUBLIC-KEY contains a set of public key types, not a single
-- type.
-- TODO The parameters should be optional only if they are marked
-- optional in the PUBLIC-KEY.


ExplicitCompositePublicKey{PUBLIC-KEY:firstPublicKey, FirstPublicKeyType,
  PUBLIC-KEY:secondPublicKey, SecondPublicKeyType} ::= SEQUENCE {
    firstPublicKey SEQUENCE {
        params firstPublicKey.&Params OPTIONAL,
        publicKey FirstPublicKeyType
    },
    secondPublicKey SEQUENCE {
        params secondPublicKey.&Params OPTIONAL,
        publicKey SecondPublicKeyType
    }
}

   Using this module, it becomes trivial to define explicit pairs.  For
   an example, see Section 6.2.2.

   To define explicit triples, quadtuples, etc, these Information
   Objects can be extended to have thirdPublicKey, fourthPublicKey, etc
   throughout.
